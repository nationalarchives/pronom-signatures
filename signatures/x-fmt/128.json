XLW files are used to restore the layout when working simultaneously on multiple workbooks, and as such do not contain any actual spreadsheet data; their only function is to store the physical layout of workbook files. They were created when the user selected View> Save Workspace in earlier versions of Excel. Versions of Excel 2013 onwards don\u2019t generate Workspace files, but you can MLlw files from Excel 2010 and before.",
