RPM files currently appear in two defined types, the first is binary package files containing the compiled version of certain software. The second is source package files containing the source code used to produce a package. These have an appropriate tag in the file header that distinguishes them from Binary RPMs, causing them to be extracted to /usr/src on installation. Source package files customarily carry the file extension \u201c.src.rpm\".",
