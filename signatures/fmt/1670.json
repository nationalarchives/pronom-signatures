Roxio Creator software allows the user to create data or audio CD layout, it allows for files to be saved for later use with references to files that will be included on the disc as well as other settings, but this format did not include the files themselves, only the information regarding these files. All versions up to version 10 and Roxio Creator 2009-2010 of layout format on Roxio Easy Media Creator software, saved their 'layout' files in ROXIO format, but this format only saves audio type files, see separate entry for data files (fmt/1669).",
