  "formatDescription": "A standard for lossless or near-lossless compression of images, also known as ISO/IEC 14495-1 and ITU Recommendation T.87, created by the Joint Photographics Experts Group (JPEG). It was developed as a low complexity lossless image compression standard in 1999, and was based on LOCO-I algorithm. JPEG-LS also provides a lossy mode. It has faster compression than JPEG 2000 and is considered better than the original lossless JPEG standard.",
