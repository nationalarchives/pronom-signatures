  "formatDescription": "A PHP script page (PHP script) written in PHP (PHP Hypertext Prepocessor) languge is a source code file that can be run by a PHP interpreter. PHP is a server-side scripting language that is often used to process inputs taken from the web and deliver dynamic content back to the HTTP client. PHP can be used as a generic scripting language, and so may be found in a standalone context, i.e. run on the command-line by calling the `php` command with the php script name as a command-line argument. A PHP script file may be an single script that is standalone or in support of a website, or form part of a number of scripts that form a module or library depending on the design pattern adopted by the developers of the script.",
