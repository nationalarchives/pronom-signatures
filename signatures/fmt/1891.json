  "formatDescription": "The Digital Voice File (DVF) is an audio file format that was used for recording messages on certain Sony IC recorder models, including the ICD-BP100 and ICD-BP120. This format uses the TRC codecs for formating,  however, DVF files utilised both the Long-term Predicted Excitation Coding (LPEC) and TRC codecs in their formation. As of March 31, 2017, the software used to manage the DVF files, known as Digital Voice Editor, was discontinued and is no longer available for download.",
