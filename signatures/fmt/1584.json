  "formatDescription": "ADRIFT Text Adventure File is an Interactive Fiction games file, produced by Campbell Wild's ADRIFT (Adventure Developer & Runner - Interactive Fiction Toolkit). \r\n\r\nADRIFT was created for Miscrosoft Windows and runs under Windows 95, 98, and NT. It does not require extensive programming knowledge, as it provides a series of dialog boxes which can be filled-out with descriptions and properties of each location, object and character. It is not based on the traditional model of compiled source and interpreted binary files but instead, a game exists only as a single binary file which is created by the Generator (a series of specialised editors) and read by the Runner. Both components use a Windows-style graphical interface, and are largely mouse-driven.",
