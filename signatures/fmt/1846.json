  "formatDescription": "Fountain is a free and open source markup language designed for writing formatted screenplays. It is saved as UTF-8 text, and as such can be viewed and written in a simple text editor, and saved with the extension .txt, but is also compatible with programmes such as Storyist or Trelby. Fountain is the result of the merging of two lauguages; Scrippets by John August and Nima Yousefi, and Screenplay Markdown by Stu Maschwitz.",
