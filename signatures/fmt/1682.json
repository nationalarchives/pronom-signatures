  "formatDescription": "EndNote Library file format is generated and used via EndNote reference management software application. EndNote is a software intended for the management of bibliographies and references when producing academic text or reports. Endnote software was first launched in 1989 by Niles & Associates, then in 2000 was acquired by Institute for Scientific Information\u2019s Research Soft Division, and since 2016 owned by Clarivate. The EndNote Library file format stores the references and citations in so called 'libraries' used with the software. Users of EndNote application can create their own EndNote Library files, as well as upload EndNote Library files onto their software. The latter versions of this software starting from version 8, include .data folder to accompany the EndNote Library format, the .data folder is automatically created by EndNote, intended to store attachments. Following this update, the data folder is recommended to be present in the EndNote Library file structure in order to use the EndNote Library format with the EndNote software. This entry describes versions X and all sequential to version X9, which changed from binary type of file format to ZIP container. In later versions starting from version X users have the ability to compress EndNote Library files using the EndNote application in purpose to share their files with other EndNote users.  The record of the Compressed EndNote Library file format as well as, subsequent versions, which were named starting from version 20, are included in separate PRONOM entry. Please see the full version history using the Web Archive Wikipedia entry link included in the Notes section.",
