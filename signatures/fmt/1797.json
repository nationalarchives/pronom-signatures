  "formatDescription": "SHA-512 is part of the family of SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), a set of cryptographic hash functions which are designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). SHA-512 produces a 512-bit (64-byte) hash value, typically rendered as a 128 digits long hexadecimal number. It can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity. The SHA-512 file is a plain text document which contains single or multiple hash values.",
