  "formatDescription": "Stata .do command files are optional text files used with in Stata, a research data analysis and statistical software package. Stata users can compile commands for Stata to run into a .do file, rather than typing them via the keyboard. This means commands do not have to be typed over and over again, and sets of commands can be reproduced at a later date. Such files are called .do files because the command that causes them to be executed is \u2018do\u2019. These files can be generated using a standard text editor, or the do-file editor which is built into Stata.",
