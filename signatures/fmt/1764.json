  "formatDescription": "A Sony SLV file is automatically generated by some models of Sony cameras when an error occurs during filming, such as a power cut or a media issue or when the camera fails to close properly during an improper shutdown. Although no official documentation has been found, various forum posts claim that SLV stands for salvage and that these files are created to assist the camera in salvaging lost data, by creating an XML file and then auto-deleting after this process is complete.",
