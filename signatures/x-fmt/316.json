  "formatDescription": "The Dr. Halo Bitmap file format, created by Media Cybernetics in 1984, was designed to facilitate image transfer between MS-DOS applications, making it one of the early device-independent bitmap formats. It is closely associated with the HALO Image File Format Library and software like the Dr. Halo raster graphics editor. The format primarily includes a .CUT file for bitmap image data and a .PAL file for color palette information. While initially popular in MS-DOS environments for basic graphic interchange, the Dr. Halo format was eventually superseded by more versatile formats as personal computing advanced.",
