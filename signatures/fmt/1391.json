  "formatDescription": "Binary DXF format is the binary encoded variant of the Drawing Interchange File Format, an exchange format for vector graphics developed by AutoDesk. They are probably the widely-used formats for exchanging vector data, and have become a de-facto industry standard. The format is owned by AutoDesk and typically changes with each release of their AutoCAD family of products. DXF files contain a tagged representation of the vector data. The structure comprises a Header section, followed by sections containing data on Classes, Tables, Blocks, Entities and, optionally, thumbnail images. Each section contains a series of data elements. each preceded by a group code tag, which indicates the type of data element. Binary DXF was first developed in AutoCAD Release 2010-2012. It should not be confused with the DXB format - this is an entirely separate AutoDesk format for binary encoding vector graphics.",
