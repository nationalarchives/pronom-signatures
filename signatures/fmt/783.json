  "formatDescription": "MXF is a media container format which supports a number of different streams of coded \"essence\", encoded with any of a variety of codecs, together with a metadata wrapper which describes the material contained within the MXF file. \r\n\r\nMXF allows for different degrees of complexity within the wrapper, which are standardised and defined as Operational Patterns, and this may be a consideration for an institution considering preserving the format, hence the separation of these Operational Patterns into separate PUIDs.\r\n\r\nOP1b is intended to meet the requirements of acquisition, storage and interchange applications where more than one essence component is required and it is wished to carry these in two or more essence containers.",
