  "formatDescription": "The Binary Interchange File Format (BIFF) is a spreadsheet file format developed by Microsoft. BIFF 5 is a native file format of Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows. The format is proprietary and Microsoft does not make details of its structure public. The information here is derived primarily from OpenOffice.org's reverse-engineered documentation of the format and should not therefore be regarded as definitive. From Excel 5.0 onwards, BIFF is based on Microsoft\u2019s generic OLE2 Compound Document Format. An Excel workbook is stored as a \u2018Book\u2019 stream within a Compound Document Format file. The Book stream comprises a Workbook Globals Substream, containing a Beginning of File (BOF) record, the Workbook global records, and terminated by an End of File (EOF) record. This is followed by one or more Worksheet substreams, containing a Beginning of File (BOF) record, the worksheet records, and terminated by an End of File (EOF) record.",
