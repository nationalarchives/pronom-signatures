This record describes version 3 of .ppt file format released in May 1992 for Windows, and included in the 3.0 version of Microsoft Office for Windows released in August 1992. Versions up to version 4 [x-fmt/88] of Microsoft PowerPoint use .ppt as extension however, they are not compatible with each other. Microsoft made backwards compatibility an optional add-on after Office 2003 and appears to have removed it altogether in Office 2010.
