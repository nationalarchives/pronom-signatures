It brings together various features such as word processsing, spreadsheets, simple drawings, image editing, and chart creation into a single document. RagTime documents feature a frame-oriented design, where every piece of content is placed within its own frame on the page. In RagTime, all data types are stored in a single document, which can include multiple layouts such as spreadsheets, images, and text. Files are saved with .rtd extension for documents and .rtt for templates. While v1-v3 were developed in Pascal, since v4 the development has been coded in C++.",
