  "formatDescription": "Comic Book Archive (or comic book reader) files are zipped/compressed folders containing a number image files (although folders may be used to group images), for the purpose of the sequential viewing of these images, usually for comic books. They use a naming system which allows them to be displayed in order when used with a comic book reader, such as CD display. Comic book archive files are not a distinct file format; only the file extension differentiates them from the compressed file type they use. Comic book archive files use the following compression: .cb7 (7z), .cba (ACE), .cbr (RAR), .cbt (TAR), .cbz ( ZIP).",
