  "formatDescription": "The GEM raster format (also known as GEM VDI Bit Image; GEM Bit Image; GEM Image; GEM Bitmap; or IMG) is an image format native to the Graphical Environment Manager (GEM) operating system and developed at Digital Research. The format was used by GEM Paint and Ventura Publisher, and by a variety of Atari ST software.\r\n\r\nGEM raster images may be color, gray scale, or black and white and are always read and written in the big-endian format. The format of bi-level images is well standardized, but the specification is ambiguous as to the format of color images. As a result, other color formats of GEM raster image were later developed, some of which have their own names, such as XIMG (Extended GEM Bit Image), TIMG (TrueColor IMG), STTT, or Hyperpaint.",
