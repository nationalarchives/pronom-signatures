  "formatDescription": "MXF is a media container format which supports a number of different streams of coded \"essence\", encoded with any of a variety of codecs, together with a metadata wrapper which describes the material contained within the MXF file. \r\n\r\nMXF allows for different degrees of complexity within the wrapper, which are standardised and defined as Operational Patterns, and this may be a consideration for an institution considering preserving the format, hence the separation of these Operational Patterns into separate PUIDs.\r\n\r\nOP2a is intended to meet the requirements of acquisition, storage and interchange applications that are satisfied by a play-list of individual items of content packaged in two or more essence containers each of the same type.",
