  "formatDescription": "The MD5 algorithm is a hash function producing a 128-bit hash value, it is described in RFC 1321. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. The MD5 file is a text document which contains single or multiple MD5 values.",
