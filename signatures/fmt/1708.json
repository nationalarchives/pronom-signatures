Following a merger of Adobe Systems and Adulus Corporation in 1994, the software was re-branded to Adobe Persuasion and a Microsoft Windows version was released. There were two versions released for Macintosh only, then starting with version 2.x, a version for Windows was released with each new release up to version 4. Version 4 was released in 1996 and was bundled with other Adobe applications. Adobe discontinued production of the software in September 1997.",
