It is the successor to PageMaker, software previously created by Aldus Corporation in 1985, which was subsequently acquired by Adobe. It can be used to produce a number of works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations and books. InDesign supports XML, stylesheets and other coding markup, providing functionality for exporting tagged text content for use in other digital and online formats. An InDesign Library is used to collect assets and other elements within Adobe InDesign that can then be shared across multiple projects.",
