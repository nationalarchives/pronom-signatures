  "formatDescription": "TOML (Tom’s Obvious Minimal Language) was created by Tom Preston-Werner, in the github repository tom-lang. TOML is a minimal configuration file format that is designed with clear semantics so as to be easily human-readable. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table (synonymous with a dictionary or map) and so can be parsed and understood by a number of programming languages. Data structures represented by TOML can often be mapped into other languages as required such as JSON or YAML.",
