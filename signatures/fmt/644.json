  "formatDescription": "NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is an open source system to create Windows installers. NSIS is script-based and although it has regular and well defined syntax, there are no magic numbers or header sequences. As such, there is no current means to identify a file as NSIS by binary sequence alone, so identification of this format is by extension only.",
