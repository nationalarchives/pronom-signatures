This record describes version 4 of .ppt file format for Macintosh, released in October 1994. Versions prior to version 4 of Microsoft PowerPoint also use .ppt as extension, however they are not compatible with each other. Microsoft made backwards compatibility an optional add-on after Office 2003 and appears to have removed it altogether in Office 2010.",
