Due to security concerns Microsoft advise against using the format and have supplied a patch for removal of the application (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3161102/update-for-windows-journal-component-removal). Microsoft also provide an update that re-installs a version of Windows Journal that highlights the security concerns (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3162655/windows-journal-application-for-windows). A JTP is a Windows Journal Template file, however this appears to be structurally identical to a JNT file.",
