  "formatDescription": "C/C++ Header File can come with extension .hpp, .hxx or .h and are text header files written in the C or C++ programming language. File extension .h are preffered to be used in C programming language but are also compatable with C++. The .hpp extension is preffered to be used in C++ header file (the \"pp\" in extension presumably stands for \"plus, plus\"). These files are mainly categorized as developer files using the correct file extension, they can be inserted to a .cpp source code file, provided the \u201c#include directive\u201d is used. Due to type of this file format a magic bytes sequence could not be established and this format is only recognised by its exension, please contact the PRONOM team if you can provide any more information.",
